# Introduction

In England, [a recent
article](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40834-022-00169-w){style="color: blue;"}
revealed changes in prescribing of contraception between 2019 and 2020
on account of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and associated restrictions. I
will examine if this is the case in Scotland too.

I have divided contraceptive prescriptions into three classes:
long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), oral (OC), and emergency
contraception (EC).

| LARC                 | Oral              | Emergency               |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Injections           | Combined          | Levonorgestorel (1.5mg) |
| Intrauterine systems | Progesterone-only | Ulipristal acetate      |
| Intrauterine devices |                   |                         |
| Implants             |                   |                         |

-   Oral contraceptives require the least health care resources to
    prescribe.

-   Emergency contraception is frequently dispensed from community
    pharmacies.

-   LARC requires skilled healthcare professionals to dispense it, as
    their insertion or injection requires additional training. This is
    often in GP surgeries of GUM clinics.

I imagine that due to Covid-19 restrictions, there will likely be a
decrease in prescribing of LARC, and emergency contraception due to
social restrictions. I also imagine that an associated uptick in the
numbers of oral contraceptive prescriptions will be dispensed due to
these drugs being prescribed in place of LARC.

**Hypothesis 1: in Scotland, as in England, contraceptives prescribed in
the community changed due to Covid-19 lockdowns.**

**Hypothesis 2: in Scotland, contraceptives prescribed in the community
during Covid-19 lockdowns differed by deprivation.**

I will examine these hypotheses using data from the *Prescribing in the
Community Dataset* from NHS Scotland, geospatial data, and the Scottish
Index of Multiple Deprivation.

CompletePrescriptionDataset <- bind_rows(DFList)
```

```{r LoadPrescriptionsData, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
CompletePrescriptionDataset <- readRDS(here ("Data", "CompletePrescriptionDataset.RDS"))
```

## Other Datasets

We'll also import three more datasets: Health Board names and codes, GP
Practice data and codes, and the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation
data from 2020 as well as some geospatial data used for plotting later.

```{r LoadAndWrangleOtherDatasets, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Contraception Data

Here we filter the `CompletePrescriptions` dataset for different types
of contraception and join them together into a tibble for each of our
three types of contraception - LARC, Oral, and Emergency.

```{r ContraceptionData, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Extracting contraception data into seperate tibbles from all prescriptions data
Injection <- CompletePrescriptionDataset %>% 
  filter(str_detect(BNFItemCode, "0703022M"))
IUS <- CompletePrescriptionDataset %>% 
  filter(str_detect(BNFItemCode, "0703023"))
IUD <- CompletePrescriptionDataset %>% 
  filter(str_detect(BNFItemCode, "21040"))
Implant <- CompletePrescriptionDataset %>% 
  filter(str_detect(BNFItemDescription, "NEXPLANON"))
LARCList <- list(IUD, IUS, Implant, Injection)
LARC <- map_df(LARCList, Wrangle)
EmergencyContraception <- CompletePrescriptionDataset %>% 
  filter(str_detect(BNFItemCode, "0703050")) %>% Wrangle(.)
OralContraception <- CompletePrescriptionDataset %>%
  filter(str_detect(BNFItemCode, "0703010")) %>%
  filter(str_detect(BNFItemDescription, "TAB")) %>% 
  rbind(., CompletePrescriptionDataset %>% filter(str_detect(BNFItemCode, "0703021"))) %>% Wrangle(.)
```

## Mapping Data

Here, we wrangle the geospatial data loaded earlier and calculate the
percentage change in contraception prescriptions dispensed before and
during the first lockdown.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Wrangling geospatial data and healthboards into one tibble
SIMDHealthBoards <- left_join(SIMD, HealthBoards)
PercentageChangeAllContraception <- bind_rows((PercentageChange(LARC) %>%  mutate(Type = "LARC")), (PercentageChange(EmergencyContraception) %>% mutate(Type = "EC")), (PercentageChange(OralContraception) %>% mutate(Type = "OC")) %>% mutate(Type = as.factor(Type)))
PreLockdownMeanDispensed <- MeanPrescriptionsDispensed(PercentageChangeAllContraception, "2015-10-01", "2020-03-20")
Lockdown1MeanDispensed <- MeanPrescriptionsDispensed(PercentageChangeAllContraception, "2020-03-21", "2020-07-19")
DifferenceMeanDispensed <- left_join(PreLockdownMeanDispensed, Lockdown1MeanDispensed, by = c("HealthBoardName", "HealthBoard", "HealthBoardCode", "Type")) %>% 
  mutate(Difference = round(((MeanPrescriptionsDispensed.y-MeanPrescriptionsDispensed.x)/MeanPrescriptionsDispensed.x) * 100, 0))
HealthBoardDeprivationRanks <- SIMDHealthBoards %>% 
  group_by(HealthBoardCode, HB) %>% 
  summarise(SumSIMD = sum(SIMD2020v2_Vigintile), numDZ = sum(n_distinct(DZ)), Rank = as.factor(round(SumSIMD/numDZ, 0)), .groups = "drop") %>%  mutate(Rank = fct_relevel(Rank, c("13", "12", "11", "10", "9")))
HealthBoardsDifferenceSPDF <- left_join(HealthBoardsSPDF, DifferenceMeanDispensed)
HealthBoardsDeprivationSPDF <- left_join(HealthBoardsSPDF, HealthBoardDeprivationRanks)
```

```

![](images/Rplot02.png){width="103mm"}

In Panel A, we can see that throughout the period before the first
lockdown in March 2020, there was a variable but fairly consistent rate
of LARC prescriptions within each Health Board. From March 2020 we see
an immediate steep decline in LARC being dispensed, supporting the first
hypothesis that restricted access to sexual health service providers due
to Covid-19 restrictions was common to both Scotland and England.

In Panel B, we see a 'zoomed-in' view of of the 2020-22, and can see the
same trend reflected nationally, and in each lockdown. However, the
decrease in LARC prescribing is never as severe as, and is quicker to
recover than in March 2020.

## How did contraceptive prescribing change during Lockdown 1?

```{r ContraceptionTimePeriodsTable, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#Create tibble of wrangled data
TableData <- bind_rows(TableWrangle(LARC), TableWrangle(OralContraception), TableWrangle(EmergencyContraception))
#Create a gt table showing % change before lockdown vs during
TableData %>% gt() %>% 
  #Table styling
cols_hide(PercentageChange) %>% tab_header(title = "Mean Quantities of Contraception Dispensed by NHS Scotland", subtitle = "Between October 2015 and July 2020") %>% 
  cols_label(TimePeriod = "Time Period", TimePeriodDates = "Dates", PercentageChangePretty = "Percentage Change", MeanPrescriptionsDispensedPerHealthBoardPerTimePeriod = "Mean Prescriptions Dispensed Per Month Per Health Board") %>%
  tab_row_group(label = "LARC", rows = 1:2) %>% tab_row_group(label = "Oral Contraception", rows = 3:4) %>% tab_row_group(label = "Emergency Contraception", rows = 5:6) %>% cols_move(TimePeriodDates, after = TimePeriod) %>% 
  fmt_integer(MeanPrescriptionsDispensedPerHealthBoardPerTimePeriod) %>% tab_style(style = list(cell_text(color = "red")), locations = cells_body(columns = PercentageChangePretty, rows = PercentageChange < 0)) %>% tab_style(style = list(cell_text(color = "chartreuse4")), locations = cells_body(columns = PercentageChangePretty, rows = PercentageChange > 0)) %>% gt_theme_538() %>% tab_options(heading.align = "center", row_group.font.weight = "bold", row_group.background.color = "turquoise", row.striping.background_color = "grey90") %>% opt_row_striping() %>% cols_align(align = "center", columns = c(TimePeriodDates:PercentageChangePretty))
```

Here, we are exploring whether this effect is replicated across all
three categories of contraception in March 2020.

![](Table1.png){width="200mm"}

Evidently, it is. There is a very similar decrease (\~ 35%) in
prescriptions for LARC - due to reasons mentioned previously - and
emergency contraception, presumably due to social restrictions leading
to less sexual activity overall, reducing the number of emergency
contraception prescriptions dispensed. Oral contraception also
decreased, but interestingly only by around 20%. I propose this decrease
is lessened as women seeking LARC were likely being prescribed oral
contraceptives instead.

## Are there differences in contraceptive prescribing between Health Boards?

```{r MapOverallChangesPlot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Create key for map plot of health boards (Panel A)
MapKeyPlot <- ggplot(data = HealthBoardsSPDF) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = HealthBoardName)) +
  theme_void() + ggtitle("Health Boards Key") + guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol = 2))
#Create map plot of health board deprivation ranks (Panel B)
MapDeprivationRanksPlot <- ggplot(data = HealthBoardsDeprivationSPDF) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Rank)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Greens", direction = -1, labels = c("Least Deprived", " ", " ", " ", "Most Deprived"), "Health Board \nDeprivation Rank") +
  theme_void() + ggtitle("Health Board Deprivation Ranks")
#Create map plot of % change in prescriptions dispensed before vs during lockdown by health board (Panel C)
MapPrescriptionChangePlot <- ggplot(data = HealthBoardsDifferenceSPDF) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Difference)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Spectral", direction = 1) +
  theme_void() +
  facet_wrap(~ Type, nrow = 1) + ggtitle("Percentage Change Pre-Lockdown vs Lockdown 1")
#Put panels together into patchwork plot
MapPlotsPatchworkA <-  (MapKeyPlot + MapDeprivationRanksPlot) / MapPrescriptionChangePlot + plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A', title = "Changes at the Health Board level are independent of deprivation.", subtitle = "There is no apparent pattern between the deprivation level of a Health Board and changes in the type or quantity of contraception dispensed.", caption = "EC: emergency contraception, LARC: long-acting reversible contraception, OC: oral contraception.")
```

Here, we are looking at deprivation on the Health Board level (key in
Panel A). Health Boards have been ranked into one of 5 categories of
mean deprivation based upon the SIMD vigintiles the data zones they
contain fall into (Panel B).

![](images/Rplot12.png){width="145mm"}

Looking at the percentage change of different types of contraception
dispensed (Panel C), there does not appear to be a clear pattern linking
the changes in either the type or quantity of contraceptives being
prescribed and the overall deprivation of the Health Board (Panel B). It
is clear that bar emergency contraception prescriptions in NHS Ayrshire
and Arran, there is a large overall decrease in contraception
prescriptions across Scotland in the lockdown of March 2020.

## How does deprivation affect contraceptive prescribing?

```{r MapDeprivationChangesPlot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Create map plot of SIMD vigintile 1 z-score changes in contraception prescribing before vs during Lockdown 1
MapTypeChangesPlot1 <- MapTypeChangesPlot(1, "2020-03-01", "Reds") + ggtitle("Most Deprived Areas")
#Create map plot of SIMD vigintile 20 z-score changes in contraception prescribing before vs during Lockdown 1
MapTypeChangesPlot20 <- MapTypeChangesPlot(20, "2020-03-01", "Blues") + ggtitle("Least Deprived Areas") + guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1))
#Put panels together into patchwork plot
MapPlotsPatchworkB <- MapTypeChangesPlot1 / MapTypeChangesPlot20 + plot_annotation(caption = "N.B. Islands have been removed as they have no data zones in Rank 20 or Rank 1.\nz-Score scale: mean (μ) ± n standard deviations (σ).\nEC: emergency contraception, LARC: long-acting reversible contraception, OC: oral contraception.", title =  "Deprivation affects the type and quantity of contraceptives prescribed in Lockdown.", subtitle = "Differences in contraceptive prescribing due to Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland from March to July 2020 compared with October 2015 to Februrary 2020.")
```

Here, we look at whether differences exist between the most deprived
(SIMD vigintile 1), or least deprived (SIMD vigintile 20), broken down
by Health Board area. These results have been normalised, and are
presented as z-scores.

![](images/Rplot09.png){width="155mm"}

Some Health Boards, such as NHS Borders seem to have little difference
between different forms of contraception, and between the areas of
highest and lowest deprivation. However, others such as NHS Grampian,
display much larger differences in both areas.

# Summary

In summary, we have seen:

-   A large decrease in prescribing of LARC in Scotland across all
    Health Boards.

-   A large decrease in the prescriptions dispensed for Oral and
    Emergency contraception and LARC.

-   There appears to be little pattern to this by Health Board, despite
    the overall differences in Deprivation between them.

-   However, when the data are viewed more granularly at an individual
    Data Zone level, there does appear to be differences in prescribing
    within and between Health Boards.
