# NHS Scotland Open Prescribing Data

This repository holds my code for my final project as a part of the Data Science for Health and Biomedical Sciences course at the University of Edinburgh.

Here, I looked at freely available prescriptions data from Scottish GPs to produce a ten page report on a topic of my choosing. I decided to investiagte the changes in prescribing of contraceptives in Covid-19. I went further and looked to see if these changes were affected by deprivation, using data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.
